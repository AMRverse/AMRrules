ECO:0001091	knockout phenotypic evidence	ECO:0001091 knockout phenotypic evidence	E.g. evidence that knocking out the proposed AMR gene in a phenotypically resistant strain results in loss of resistance
ECO:0000012	functional complementation evidence	ECO:0000012 functional complementation evidence	E.g. evidence that, when a gene knockout results in change from R to S, the phenotype is reversed (resistance is restored) when the gene is reintroduced
ECO:0001113	point mutation phenotypic evidence	ECO:0001113 point mutation phenotypic evidence	E.g. for a mutation, evidence that this specific mutation is associated with a change in susceptibility phenotype
ECO:0000024	protein-binding evidence	ECO:0000024 protein-binding evidence	E.g. evidence that the gene product binds to this drug
ECO:0001034	crystallography evidence	ECO:0001034 crystallography evidence	E.g. structural evidence from crystallography that the mutated position in this gene product interacts with the drug
ECO:0000005	enzymatic activity assay evidence	ECO:0000005 enzymatic activity assay evidence	E.g. evidence that the gene product has enzymatic activity against the drug
ECO:0000042	gain-of-function mutant phenotypic evidence	ECO:0000042 gain-of-function mutant phenotypic evidence	E.g. for a mutation, evidence that introducing this specific mutation into a wildtype background is associated with a change in susceptibility phenotype
ECO:0007000	high throughput mutant phenotypic evidence	ECO:0007000 high throughput mutant phenotypic evidence	E.g. evidence from a transposon mutant library that mutation or loss of a gene in a phenotypically resistant strain results in loss of resistance
ECO:0001103	natural variation mutant evidence	ECO:0001103 natural variation mutant evidence	E.g. for an acquired gene or mutation, evidence that natural variation in presence vs absence is associated with susceptibility to the drug (genotype-phenotype association in a natural population)
ECO:0005027	genetic transformation evidence	ECO:0005027 genetic transformation evidence	E.g. evidence that transfer of the gene into a susceptible recipient strain results in resistance
ECO:0000020	protein inhibition evidence	ECO:0000020 protein inhibition evidence	E.g. evidence that a mutation inhibits protein function to reduce interaction the effect of the drug and confer resistance
ECO:0006404	experimentally evolved mutant phenotypic evidence	ECO:0006404 experimentally evolved mutant phenotypic evidence	E.g. evidence that the mutation arises in response to drug exposure during experimental evolution, resulting in resistant mutants
ECO:0000054	double mutant phenotype evidence	ECO:0000054 double mutant phenotype evidence	E.g. evidence resulting from an experiment typically constructed to determine if two different genes have an observable genetic interaction (functional connection) as the result of a mutation occurring in the alleles of the two genes of interest
ECO:0000154 	heterologous protein expression evidence	ECO:0000154 heterologous protein expression evidence	E.g. a type of protein expression evidence where a gene from one cell is inserted into a cell that does not typically contain that gene and heterologous protein expression is assessed
ECO:0000006 	experimental evidence	ECO:0000006 experimental evidence	Experimental evidence not otherwise classified
ECO:0001583	small interfering RNA knockdown evidence	ECO:0001583 small interfering RNA knockdown evidence	E. g. a type of anti-sense experiment evidence where gene expression is disrupted through the introduction of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 base pairs in length, which operate within the RNA interference pathway
