Evidence grade,What it means,Use this when
high,"The curators are confident in the categorisation, and believe that the likelihood that the effect will be substantially different from this is low.","Experimental evidence provides strong support for the interpretation of this gene/variant in this species for this drug. If there is statistical geno/pheno evidence available, it supports this interpretation."
moderate,"The curators believe that the categorisation most likely reflects the true effect, and the likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is moderate.","There is good evidence to support the interpretation of this gene/variant in this species for this drug, but there is some uncertainty (e.g. lack of direct evidence in this organism although evidence from related organisms is convincing; or there is good statistical geno/pheno evidence but no experimental evidence of mechanism)."
low,"The curators believe that the categorisation might not reflect the true effect, and the likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is high.","There is evidence supporting a link between this gene/variant and this drug, but the interpretation in this species is unclear (e.g. lack of evidence in this organism or related organisms; statistical geno/pheno evidence is lacking, or does not support a clear effect; or there are trustworthy but conflicting reports)."
very low,"The curators have no confidence that the categorisation reflects the true effect, and the likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is high.","There is no trustworthy evidence as to the effect in this organism, or there is conflicting evidence. The categorical interpretation is based on assumptions made from unrelated organisms and may be wrong."
